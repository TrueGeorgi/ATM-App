# ATM-App

In order to put my skills into practice i have created this ATM-app. In the project i have used the following concepts and constructs:
  * Class
  * Object
  * Method
  * LinkedHashMap
  * For-loop
  * Switch
  * While
etc.

## What the app do

The app gives the user the option to create a database of bank accounts and do different transactions. At the begging the user will be asked if he wants to log in with an ID or to create an account. If he just starts the programm, there are no accounts in the database, so the user's only option will be to create a new account. Each account has gets:
  * title - provided by the user
  * First name of the customer - provided by the user
  * Family name of the customer - provided by the user
  * ID - provided by the app. The ID is unique and cannot be repeated.
  * account balance - starting with 0.
  
after an account is created, the user can choose from 5 actions:
  * Withdraw - where the user can withdraw an amount from their account balance
  * Deposit - where the user can deposit an amount to increase their account balance
  * Balance enquiry - to see what is the current stand of their accout balance
  * Transfer - to transfer funds to another existing account
  * Log out - to log out of their account

The user can do multiple actions before logging out. After this, there is the option the continue the application and add other users, so they can transfer funds between each other.

If there is no such desire, the app can be terminated.
